Design issues
=============

The goal with WebKOM is an easy to use system, primarily suitable for
novices but also others. One example of how this is reflected in the
user interface is the "visible principle": Alla conferences, articles
etc should be visible, even if an article for example has already been
read. Most other LysKOM clients only view unread articles and
conferences. Some users get frustrated when articles "disappear" just
after they have read them.

All documentationn files etc should be in english, like the source
code. When the GUI is translated, the source code should not containt
any swedish.
