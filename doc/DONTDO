Things I have thought of but now consider a bad idea
====================================================

* Use -initial-env PATH=/path/to/python to get rid of the
wrapper-script. Bad, because it would not be possible to change path
without restarting Apache.

* Dont use __del__ finalizers, as they prevent the GC from doing it's job.
