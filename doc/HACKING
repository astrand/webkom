Coding standards
================
* Use two blank rows between classes and standalone functions, one
  blank row between methods in the same class.

* Class names as usual: ThisIsAClass.

* Variable names like this: some_nice_variable.

* Variables representing numbers should have "num" as a part their
  names rather than "no". Example: conf_num (conference number). NOTE:
  kom.py uses "no". 

* Python files that are specific to webkom should have a name
  beginning with "webkom_" (like webkom_utils.py). Python files that
  are not specific to WebKOM should not have this prefix. If the
  module contains a single class, it should names with the first
  letter capitalized (like TranslatorCache.py).
