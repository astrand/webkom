Coding standards
================
* Use two blank rows between classes and standalone functions, one
  blank row between methods in the same class.

* Class names as usual: ThisIsAClass.

* Variable names like this: some_nice_variable.

* Variables representing numbers should have "num" as a part their
  names rather than "no". Example: conf_num (conference number). NOTE:
  kom.py uses "no".
