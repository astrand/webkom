Coding standards
================
PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code
(http://python.sourceforge.net/peps/pep-0008.html) should be
obeyed. The current source may not conform to these guide. Feel free
to fix any discrepancies. 

Additionally:

* Variables representing numbers should have "num" as a part their
  names rather than "no". Example: conf_num (conference number). NOTE:
  kom.py uses "no". 

* Python files that are specific to webkom should have a name
  beginning with "webkom_" (like webkom_utils.py). Python files that
  are not specific to WebKOM should not have this prefix. If the
  module contains a single class, it should names with the first
  letter capitalized (like TranslatorCache.py). 

* Imports: Do not import modules with *. Exceptions to this rule is
  webkom_constants, HTMLgen and webkom_utils.

* Strings should be written with double quotes like "this". 

* The Maximum Line Length should be 80, just as PEP8
  suggests. However, if you feel this is a bad decision, feel free to
  contact me. The policy of 80 columns may change in the future.


Handling submits
================
The user should always be able to press reload in the browser, without
risking posting articles twice etc. This works as follows: The classes
that is responsible for submit response generation should either
directly handle multiple submits, or use a special mechanism. It works
as follows: Instead of appending directly to the response document,
create an Container and append to it. Before returning, call
self.submit_redir() with this container as argument. 

Look at LeaveConfSubmit for an example of how to do this. 


About hardcoding site-specific configuration
============================================
Hardconding site-specific configuration should be avoided. This
includes specifying shebangs like "#!/usr/local/python2.1". Shebangs
should be written like this:

#!/usr/bin/env python2

Use "python2" is the application requires Python 2 or newer, use
"python" is version 1.X or newer is OK etc.
